## üõ† Commands Used

### Most Important Commands
```bash
# Login to CSC Rahti
oc login https://api.2.rahti.csc.fi:6443

# Create project
oc new-project my-data-pipeline --description="csc_project: 2001234"

# Build and push images
.\scripts\build-and-push-microservices.ps1

# Deploy all services
.\scripts\deploy-microservices.ps1

# Check deployment status
oc get pods
oc get routes
```

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Watch pods during deployment
oc get pods -w

# Check service logs
oc logs -f deployment/data-ingest
oc logs -f deployment/data-clean
oc logs -f deployment/data-visualization

# Check resource usage
oc top pods

# View events for troubleshooting
oc get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```

### Scaling Commands
```bash
# Scale individual services
oc scale deployment/data-clean --replicas=3
oc scale deployment/data-visualization --replicas=2

# Auto-scaling setup
oc autoscale deployment/data-clean --min=1 --max=5 --cpu-percent=70
```

## üìä Architecture Analysis

### Microservices Benefits Observed
- **Independent Scaling**: Successfully scaled data-clean service to 3 replicas while keeping Redis at 1
- **Service Isolation**: When data-ingest pod crashed, other services continued working
- **Resource Optimization**: Allocated different CPU/memory limits per service based on needs
- **Independent Updates**: Updated visualization service without affecting data processing
- **Monitoring Granularity**: Could monitor each service separately with detailed metrics

### Challenges Encountered
- **Network Complexity**: Had to debug service-to-service communication issues
- **Storage Configuration**: Required shared persistent volumes instead of simple EmptyDir
- **Service Discovery**: Needed to configure proper DNS names for inter-service communication
- **Deployment Order**: Services had dependencies (Redis first, then others)

### Performance Observations
- **Network Latency**: Slight increase in latency compared to localhost communication
- **Resource Overhead**: Each pod has some overhead, total memory usage higher than single pod
- **Scaling Efficiency**: Could scale only the data-clean service during heavy processing loads
- **Fault Recovery**: Individual service failures didn't affect the entire pipeline
